    <p>Hi, I’m Dy ann Razonado, a passionate and detail-oriented Web Developer with a strong foundation in building fast, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications. With experience in both front-end and back-end development, I love turning complex problems into elegant solutions. I specialize in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Node.js, and Express, and I’m always eager to learn and adopt new tools that help me build better products. Whether it's creating a sleek landing page, designing a fully functional web app, or optimizing code for performance, I enjoy every part of the development process. Beyond code, I value clear communication, team collaboration, and user-centered design. I aim to create digital experiences that not only look good but also work seamlessly across all devices. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see what I’ve built—and if you’re interested in working together, don’t hesitate to reach out!</p>
